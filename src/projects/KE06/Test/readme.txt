@par Example description
     ===================
This example provides a template for the sample code. It demonstrates how to 
configure RTC with 1Hz and  how to switch clock mode from FEE to FEI as well as
how to initialize UART. 
It will echo the character entered in the terminal and at meanwhile 
it will flash red led at every 1s.

@par Code configuration
     ===================
Make sure the following macros are defined in ke06_config.h: \n
   USE_FEE and  \n
   EXT_CLK_FREQ_KHZ macro is defined to 10000.


@par Directory contents
     ===================
- platforms/ke06_config.h     library and board Configuration file
- projects/ke06/isr.h         Interrupt handler installation
- projects/ke06/Test.c    Main program


@par Hardware environment
     ====================
 - Board: freedom FRDM-KE06Z, revA
  
@par How to use it
     =============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Rebuild all project files and load demo code into the device
- Connect J6 USB port to the computer that will find serial terminal port
- Open the serial terminal
- Configure the serial terminal to protocol: 8-N-1, 115200bps, and flow control: none
